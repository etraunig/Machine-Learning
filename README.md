# Machine Learning Repo

This is the place where I will store everything I've done in my ML classes, including assignments, works and challenges

### Kaggle:
Challenges done in class for extra points in tests, the first one was to make a classifier for a diseases dataset that had +81% accuracy, and the second one was to classify comments as positive or negative

### Work 1: 
Choose a public dataset (minimum of 5 features) and solve a classification problem with it.

### Work 2:
Choose one of 4 options (Computer Vision was the chosen one), develop an application that uses it and apply/show metrics for reviews
